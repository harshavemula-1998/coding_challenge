This JavaScript Snake Game is a fun, interactive game designed to be played in a web browser. It features a snake that grows in length every time it eats food. The game includes obstacles that add complexity and difficulty as the snake cannot pass through these without ending the game. The game also features golden food that appears periodically and provides extra points.

Features
Dynamic Obstacles: Randomly placed obstacles on the game board which the snake cannot pass through.
Golden Food: Appears after every five pieces of normal food are eaten and disappears if not eaten within five seconds.
Scoring System: Points are awarded for each piece of food the snake eats. Eating golden food gives extra points.
High Score Tracking: High scores are saved in local storage, so they persist across sessions.
Game Over Logic: The game ends if the snake hits an obstacle, the wall, or itself.
